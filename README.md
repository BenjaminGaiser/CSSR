# First Pair Assignment by Ben Gaiser & Jeremy Russell
7 October 2016

## Overview
This is the repository that [Jeremy](https://github.com/jrus87) and [I](https://github.com/BenjaminGaiser) are using for the assingments for  [MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis](https://github.com/HertieDataScience) at the Hertie School of Governance. We welcome any feedback or comments and you can get in touch with us via our GitHub accounts or by submitting a pull request. 

## The Repository
This repository offers you all of the R Code Files that we have used in order to create our [R-Markdown]'insert link here' file. These include our [Data Gathering file](https://github.com/BenjaminGaiser/CSSR/blob/master/DataGathering.R) and a separate but dynamically linked [Data Processing file](https://github.com/BenjaminGaiser/CSSR/blob/master/DataProcessing.R) as well as our final [HTML version]'insert link here'that cites the packages that we have used for the analysis.

## Assignment
The [first assignment](https://github.com/HertieDataScience/SyllabusAndLectures/blob/master/README.md) states the following:
>The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version control, and basic R data structures and descriptive statistics. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with a descriptive README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two data sets from the R core data sets and/or fivethirtyeight, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety of relevant descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged. Deadline 7 October, 10% of final grade.
